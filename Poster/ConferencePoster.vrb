\begin{block}{Abstract}
Sequestration of carbon in forests is a process that can pull large quantities of carbon out of the atmosphere or prevent its release to the atmosphere, 87\% of total CO2 removals in 2014. Carbon mitigation efforts have thus focused much attention on reforestation, forest management,and forest based products.  According to the most recent report to the UNFCCC, an estimated 18.7\% of the total carbon in woody materials is contained in harvested wood (HWP and SWDS).
\vspace{1ex}

The amount of carbon in HWP and SWDS depend on how much wood is harvested, what types of products are produced, how the products are used, the lifetime of the wood products, and how the wood is processed at the end of its primary product lifetime.

\begin{block}{Carbon Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 2005, the contribution to removals was 30 Tg (million metric tons) C (carbon) and 31 Tg C for the Production and Atmospheric Flow Approaches, respectively, and 44 Tg C for the Stock Change Approach. This range is 17 to 25 percent of C removals by forests, or would offset 42 percent to 61 percent of residential natural gas C emissions in 2005.
\vspace{1ex}
\item The contribution has declined under the Production and Atmospheric Flow Approaches since 1990 and has increased under the Stock Change Approach. The Stock Change estimate has increased because it explicitly includes C in increasing net imports of wood and paper products.

\begin{block}{Accounting Approaches}

\begin{itemize}
\item International workshops identified three approaches to re- port HWP contribution. These approaches focus on account- ing differently for changes in carbon in HWP imports and exports.
\item Stock Change:
\item Production:
\item Atmospheric Flow:

\begin{itemize}
\item A Monte-Carlo simulation used to assess the effect of uncertainty in inputs suggests the 90 percent confidence interval for removal contribution estimates under the three approaches is within –23\% to +19\%.

\item Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making.
